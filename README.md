# d3-line-chart
***This is an in-progress peek*** <br/>
<p>The chart is setup to handle a non-specified number of lines. I could set the color designation to loop back around, if there were ever more lines than colors. I used a color picker to find the colors and wrote a color array to dynamically color each line as it is looped. Typically, if an API endpoint is not available to set up a microservice, I would run a Json server, to access the initial data from a local json file, like the file I included, but did not use, yet. </p>
 
***With more time, I would:*** <br/>
<ul>
 <li>refine style, including adding subtle y grid dashed lines, etc.</li>
 <li>figure out how to have the data lines begin and end before and after the first and last data points</li>
 <li>setup promised data</li>
 <li>make mouse move work for all lines</li>
 <li>move the chart into react</li>
 <li>figure out what's going on with the y axis initial format, before the animation</li>
</ul>
